<h4>This was Tempest last group performance in RTK. Tempest performed a cover of SuperM "Jopping" with a futuristic feeling, the watcher being inside of a virtual reality. 
In the middle of the performance when member Hyuk was being brought up in the air by a wire while singing, the wire was dropped when he was high up, way before it was supposed to. He nearly fell ontop of back up dancers
and could of been injured, aswell as the dancers. Hyuk went on with the performance with only just a small hiccup while singing when he fell. There has been said that this was on purpose by the nettwork wanting them to get eliminated, as there was never no problem with the wire 
in the practices of the stage, and Tempest apperantly having been treated unfairy, and views from their Jopping performance being taken.
